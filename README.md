# Collaborative Filtering On Anime Dataset

This repository goes along with the Medium Post [Collaborative Filtering on Anime Dataset using fastai2](https://towardsdatascience.com/collaborative-filtering-on-anime-dataset-using-fastai2-130ae32fe433). The code was ran on Google Colab, so you might have to tweak your repository structure and comment some statements like `from google.colab import drive` which pertain particularly to Colab. 

The dataset used in analysis is MyAnimeList Recommendations dataset which could be found online on Kaggle. [Here is a link](https://www.kaggle.com/CooperUnion/anime-recommendations-database) to the dataset.
